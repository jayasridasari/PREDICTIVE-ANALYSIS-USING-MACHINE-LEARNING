# PREDICTIVE-ANALYSIS-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: DASARI JAYASRI

INTERN ID: CT04DF555

DOMAIN: DATA ANALYTICS 

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTHOSH

DESCRIPTION: This project demonstrates a predictive machine learning model to estimate studentsâ€™ math performance based on various academic and demographic features. The model uses regression to forecast student outcomes and illustrates the process of feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

Objective:
Build a regression model to predict students' math scores

Apply feature selection to identify influential variables

Use model evaluation metrics to assess prediction accuracy

Visualize actual vs predicted results

Tools & Technologies:
->Python 3

->pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

->scikit-learn

->Jupyter Notebook (for step-by-step workflow)

Dataset Information:
Source: Students Performance Dataset on Kaggle

File: StudentsPerformance.csv

Features:

Gender, Parental level of education, Lunch type

Test preparation course

Reading and writing scores

Target Variable: Math score (continuous numerical value)

ðŸš€ How to Run
Install dependencies

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Download the dataset
Place StudentsPerformance.csv in the same directory.

Run the notebook
Open student_grade_prediction.ipynb and execute all cells in order.

Key Components of the Notebook:

Data loading and visualization

Feature engineering (e.g., one-hot encoding)

Train-test split using sklearn.model_selection

Linear Regression model training

Model evaluation using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

RÂ² Score

Visual plot of actual vs predicted math scores

Visualization:

A scatter plot showing predicted vs actual math scores
